To whom it may concern,

\vspace{5mm}
Following is the statement addressing my past and potential contributions to inclusive excellence and their effects on the UC Irvine's Commitment to Inclusive Excellence.

I am, as an Asian physicist born in Japan, now working as a Ph.D. student at the University of Tokyo.
At the University, there are many students and postdocs from abroad, with whom I discuss and promote collaborative works everyday.
Sometimes they are required to submit some official documents in Japanese related to the activities outside the University, and I try to help them whenever I encounter with such a situation.
They also learn Japanese as a regular course at the University, about which I also discuss with them to obtain a profound knowledge on how they think and understand the Japanese language.
As for the academic 
Also, I frequently attend international conferences held abroad to give presentations of my own works and discuss with whoever is interested in my talk.
I am going to keep myself having an open mind as described above and believe that it will help inclusive excellence of the University I will belong to.

Sincerely yours,
