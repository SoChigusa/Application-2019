Since we now live in the electroweak vacuum, the requirement of the (meta-)stability of the vacuum can be used to test and constrain particle physics models. This approach is powerful because it can probe new particles that are too heavy to be accessed using any ongoing or planned experiment. Also, this approach is applicable to many models that contain some additional fields and/or couplings to the SM Higgs boson. During the last few years, I have been developing the next-to-leading order calculation of the decay rate of the electroweak vacuum. My treatment filled a gap of existing calculations and enabled us to precisely evaluate the decay rate with error estimations.
I was also involved in several works of the collider phenomenology. So far, I focused on the search for massive particles with electroweak charges that are dark matter candidates appearing in many well-known models. To fully use the huge amount of data of recent hadron colliders, in general, it is necessary to develop a proper physics quantity or a wise way to extract the signal of a new particle. I developed a way to use the signal shape to reduce the systematic uncertainties and obtained the best limit so far for Higgsino, a dark matter candidate in a supersymmetric model, which is generally difficult to search for.

* **What is your motivation for applying for this job / Quelles sont vos motivations pour cette candidature? (max. 1440 char.)**

As a young researcher of the theoretical particle physics, I am seeking for a postdoc position where I can engage in a broad range of fields. In CERN, there are a lot of famous physicists including both theorists and experimentalists with whom I can discuss. I would like to enlarge my research interest through the discussion with people from many fields. There are also a lot of active young postdocs in CERN. I am eager to discuss and collaborate with them and complete some innovative works during my recruitment period. Finally, it is also important for me to have a chance to work in a multinational community. I would like to keep connections made in CERN and efficiently use them to continue my research in the future.

* **If yes, specify submission date, defense date, title of thesis and name of your supervisor. Summarize your thesis in maximum 5 lines, give the most significant results obtained**

Submission date: Dec. 19, 2019.
Defense date: Jan. 2020. (Not fixed)
Title of thesis: Probing Electroweakly Interacting Massive Particles with Drell-Yan Process at 100 TeV Colliders
Supervisor: Prof. Takeo Moroi
Summary:
I focused on the search for massive particles with EW charges (EWIMPs) that are dark matter candidates appearing in many well-known models such as the supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). In particular, I focused on EWIMPs with short-lived charged components such as the Higgsino-like state in the MSSM. Since the tracker information is difficult to use in this case, instead I considered the vacuum polarization effect from the EWIMP loop on the lepton pair production process. I developed a way to use the signal shape to reduce the systematic uncertainties and obtained the best limit so far for Higgsino.
